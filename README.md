The new name Live Annotation Tools was chosen as this app can now be used in any
general live presentation setting, rather than being limited to usage in PowerPoint.

Live Annotation Tools is a desktop overlay app that allows you to 
draw anywhere on your screen! Various brushes and tools are included
to help you make drawings quick and easily - Perfect for live presentations!


This app's main focus is on helping diversify the annotation tools university
lecturers have available when conducting their lessons (both in-person and remote!), however, its usage
can be extended to any type of live presentation as well.

# How to Compile it yourself (Mini Developer Guide)

1. Clone the repo to your computer

2. You need to have node version 22.2.0 installed on your computer or there may be errors during the compilation process.

> #### What if you already have another version of Node.JS installed on your computer?
> 
> Node.JS only support having 1 version installed on a computer at a time by default. So if you are already using
> another version of Node.JS for another project, uninstalling and reinstalling Node.JS manually just to switch versions
> is very tedious and is wasting your time.
> 
> #### The Solution:
> 
> Use Node Version Manager (nvm) instead. It has solved all of my node versioning problems. Highly recommended
> to try especially if having to uninstall your current version of Node.JS already seems tedious.
