The new name Live Annotation Tools was chosen as this app can now be used in any
general live presentation setting, rather than being limited to usage in PowerPoint.

Live Annotation Tools is a desktop overlay app that allows you to 
draw anywhere on your screen! Various brushes and tools are included
to help you make drawings quick and easily - Perfect for live presentations!
This app's main focus is on helping diversify the annotation tools university
lecturers have available when conducting their lessons (both in-person and remote!), however, its usage
can be extended to any type of live presentation as well.
